# SharedEffort

SharedEffort is an Android application that serves as a family calendar. It allows you to better visualise your events and chores. 
There is also a built in rewards system for the children's chores. By finishing your chores and earning points, you can transfer the chores you want to avoid to your brothers our sisters.
